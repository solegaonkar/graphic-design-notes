## Pantone Colors

This provides industry standard set of colors - with names. Check for some way to get RGB value for these - so that they can be referred in Adobe.

## Color Harmonies
There are different color harmonies based on the wheel. By picking a base color, or starting color, we can come up with a good harmonous color pallete using the color wheel.
- Using similar colors - warm or cool, creates a uniform look. This is called color harmony. 
- Monochromatic Color Harmony - different shades of same color - a radial line on the color wheel.
- Analogous Color Harmony - Set of colors are different hues close to the main color.
- Complementary Colors - Radially opposite colors on the color wheel
- Triad - Three colors evenly spaced across the wheel

## Mood Boards
We can directly extract the color pallete from a given image, using the mood boards. That can extract a pallete with the same mood as the original image. Load the image into the adobe color

Can also do similar with Canva.com - but not as versatile as adobe.
